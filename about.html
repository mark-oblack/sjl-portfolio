				<p>My name is Shannon Lafferty and I will graduate in December with a Master's in secondary education in addition to my Bachelors of Science in Biology that I received in May 2016. I'm currently in the process of fulfilling my student teaching requirement at Mount Lebanon High School. I am responsible for teaching two subjects, Biology and Wildlife Biology, across 5 class periods each day. My student teaching placement has given me experience working with learners of all levels, including multiple students with IEPs. This diversity in learning ability provided me opportunities to modify and adjust my lesson plans to meet the needs of all learners. In addition, I also gained skills in various disciplines such as formal and informal assessment, classroom management, and providing opportunities for one-on-one tutoring.</p>
				<p>Before I began my student teaching experience, I conducted labs for homeschool students and students from Holy Family Academy at The Citizen Science Lab. Part of my duties included developing the lab curriculum, assessing student learning through lab experiments, and co-teaching with teachers from Holy Family Academy.</p>
				<p>Through both my student teaching experience at Mount Lebanon School District and experience at The Citizen Science Lab, I believe that I would make a great candidate to educate the students in your school district on the various topics under the science umbrella.</p>
